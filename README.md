* **Interesting findings**:

  * The median popularity[^1] and audio features scores[^2] of my playlist is roughly higher than TOP50 USA, and have broader range in each features.
  
  * For listeners in the USA, a distinct preference for upbeat, high-energy tracks, with a average danceability and energy score surpassing 62% and 60% repectively. Topping the list of most danceable tracks was Mac DeMarco's "Heart to Heart" with a score of 90%, while Bebe Rexha's "I'm Good(Blue)" emerged as the most energetic track with a score of 97%.
  
  * For Listeners in Taiwan, oringinal soundtracks of TV shows are fairly popular, which inevitably contributes to the lowest liveness scores of 15%.
