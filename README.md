  * The analysis of the USA Top50 playlist revealed a distinct preference for upbeat, high-energy tracks, with a median danceability and energy score surpassing 62%. Topping the list of most danceable tracks was Mac DeMarco's "Heart to Heart" with a score of 90%, while Bebe Rexha's "I'm Good(Blue)" emerged as the most energetic track with a score of 97%.
